### Homepage
Homepage contains several cards: a list of accounts, one type of statistics, a list of records, and etc. The homepage should also include important call-to-actions, such as “Add banks”. 
The goal of the homepage is to quickly onboard new users. To do this, the foremost thing to do is to show users the functionality of our app.

### Transactions 
Transaction page shows a list of transactions. 
Click into each transaction prompts a transaction detail page, where we can edit the current transaction and customize categories.
